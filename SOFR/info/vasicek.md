### Introduction

In finance, the Vasicek model is a mathematical model describing the evolution of interest rates. It is a type of one-factor short rate model as it describes interest rate movements as driven by only one source of market risk. The model can be used in the valuation of interest rate derivatives, and has also been adapted for credit markets. It was introduced in 1977 by Oldrick Vasicek, and can be also seen as a stochastic investment model:

$$\boldsymbol{dr_{t} = a(b-r_{t})\,dt+\sigma \,dW_{t}}$$

+ $b$: "long term mean level". All future trajectories of $r$ will evolve around a mean level b in the long run;

+ $a$: "speed of reversion". $a$ characterizes the velocity at which such trajectories will regroup around $b$ in time (assuming $a$ to be non-negative);

+ $\sigma$ : "instantaneous volatility", measures instant by instant the amplitude of randomness entering the system. Higher $\sigma$ implies more randomness
