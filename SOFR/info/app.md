### About

This application attempted a practical assessment of the current state of SOFR. While identifying trends of SOFR, it also took a look at the driving factors of SOFR through model fittings. And this application developed a fundamental short-term rate model and time series model to analyze the variation of SOFR. It used the Vasicek model and Monte Carlo simulation to understand how SOFR acts in the market. It also attempted to use time series analysis to study SOFR trends with particular spikes.


There are three tabs in this application to carry out this quantitative analysis process except for this information page. 

- Exploring Data Analysis: Exploring Analysis on the SOFR value.
- Modeling: Two ways of quantitative analysis (Vasicek model and ARIMA model).
- Data: Looking up and download data.
